	 <h3> George Goebel </h3>
	 </div>
		
		<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Central Casting were looking for an archetypical prestidigitator, it could do no better than George Goebel, the veteran Baltimore magician and Houdini expert. With a head of thick, wavy hair, once dark but now silver, a mustache and goatee, also silver, and dark penetrating eyes, Goebel is still the embodiment of the magician of legend.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goebel's lifelong love affair with the conjuring arts began when he was a 10-year-old growing up in the city's Evergreen neighborhood.
In 1942, a cousin gave him a Christmas gift that changed his life: a Mysto magic set made by the A.C. Gilbert Co. of New Haven, Conn., better known perhaps for its American Flyer electric trains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the elementary school student who became known as "Goebel the Magician" discovered he liked performing tricks for his classmates. By the mid-1940s, Goebel was president of the Pyramid Magic Club, and while a student at Polytechnic Institute, performed his magic in the annual "Poly Follies" talent shows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After graduating from Poly in 1950, Goebel went to work for A.T. Jones, the venerable costumer that was established in 1868 and has been in the 700 block of N. Howard St. for years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After serving in the Army, he returned to the costume company in 1955, where he managed the company and went on the road performing magic.
By the mid-1950s, Goebel was developing a reputation and a devoted following.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rauscher writes that in 1956, Goebel was "presenting escape effects in schools, churches, public exhibitions, and was also doing Houdini's needle-swallowing trick, but using razor blades instead of needles. Despite elaborate illusions, Goebel said, a traditional magic show must have three elements: "They are pulling a rabbit from a hat, floating a lady and sawing someone in half," he said.</p>
