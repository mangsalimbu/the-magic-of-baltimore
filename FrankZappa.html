		<h4 style="font-family: 'Bungee Shade';">Frank Zappa in Baltimore<br>(December 21, 1940 - December 4, 1993)</h4>
		
		
		
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Baltimore born composer, electric guitarist, record producer and film director. In a career spanning more than 30 years, Zappa wrote rock, jazz, electronic, orchestral, and musique concrete works. He also directed feature-length films and music videos, and designed album covers. Zappa produced almost all of the more than 60 albums he released with the band Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist.</p>
			
			
			
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank is a 3 time Grammy winner one for best rock instremental for <i>Jazz from Hell</i> and best boxed or special limited edition package for <i>Civilization Phaze III</i>, and finally one for the lifetime achivement award which is only given to "those preformers who during their lifetimes have made creative contributions of outstanding artistic signigicance to the feild of recording" an award which has been given to many great people such as frank sinatra, Elvis Presley, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Lifetime_Achievement_Award">more.</a>
			</p>
		
			<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank has influenced many artists such as Devo, Alice Cooper, Jimi Hendrix, even the beetle's Paul McCartney who said that their album <i>"Sargent Pepper's Lonely hearts Club Band"</i> was their verion of Frank's <i>"Freak Out".</i>
			</p>
			
			<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suprisingly its not just artsist but also scientist who are influenced by him as seen there are many things that have been named after him such as an extinct mollusc in Nevada named the <i>"Amaurtoma Zappa",</i> and in the same way there isa  jelly fish named <i>"Phialella Zappai" </i>  which apparently the ventral side of the female species resembles his moustache which he was known for.
