		<h3>Led Zeppelin in Baltimore</h3>
		
		
		
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Led Zeppelin, playing to a capacity crowd of nearly 13,000 at the Civic Center Sunday night, amply demonstrated how it became the number one British rock band after the death of the Beatles as a group. Led Zeppelin has been known primarily for heavy electronic rock. One of the most pleasant parts of the concert Sunday night was an acoustic interlude with drummer John Bonham laying out and Page, Plant and Jones (playing mandolin) seated before microphones at the front of the stage. They did several songs, including Going to California and Tangerine, the highlight of which was the tight interplay between the mandolin and guitar.</p>
			
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this event where they preformed Febuary 16th, 1969 Lez Zeppeling wasnt even the big headliner for this show even though they were the ones most people were there for, a band named "Vanilla Fudge" was the big name put on most posters. Many tickets for this event said "Vanilla fudge feat. Len & The Gun". At this event was at capacity of 14,500 people, another 4000 people were outside trying to see or hear anything from them, many people actually broke windows trying to get in to see the band where 10 were arested. this was just over a month after their first album was released and they were already this popular.
			</p>
			
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The band not only rocked Baltimore one but thrice, once on April 5th, 1970, and another time on June 11th, 1972
